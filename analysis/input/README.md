This dataset consists of archaeobotanical data of the Huizui site, Henan Province, China. The Huizui site today is separated by a modern gully, and the two separated areas of the site are referred to as Huizui East (10 ha) and Huizui West (4 ha), the latter only being occupied during the Erlitou period (Lee and Bestel 2007, 49; Liu et al. 2013, 291). The Yiluo archaeological team gathered soil samples from the Huizui site in 2002 and 2005 for archaeobotanical analysis. The samples were collected from different excavation grids covering the whole site. The University of Oregon Archaeobotany Lab at the Anthropology Department has been conducting the analyzing work. At the lab, the soil samples were processed by flotation and only the light fractions were kept. The light portions then went through a sieving process to be further classified into 2mm, 1mm, 0.4mm and 0.2mm groups. The samples were then ready to be examined and seeds identified under a Nikon microscope. Every sample was recorded with sample number, feature (the trench and unit #), feature type (ditch/house/ash pits, etc.), historical period, total weight, charcoal weight, volume, number of seeds found for each taxa, and the percentage of work done for different sieving groups. There is a total of 126 samples from the Huizui site available to be used for further analysis.
