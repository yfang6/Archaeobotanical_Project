# Introduction

The Huizui site is located in the Yiluo valley in Yanshi County, western Henan Province, China (Ford 2004, 71; Lee and Bestel 2007, 49). It has been considered a stone tool production locus during the late Longshan and Erlitou times (c. 2,500 â€“ 1,600 BC) and a secondary center in the hinterland of the Erlitou state (Ford 2004; Liu et al. 2013, 278-279). The Yiluo team has conducted intensive excavations at the Huizui site since 1998, revealing a total of 665 square meters of human occupation of the site (Lee and Bestel 2007, 49). Previous archaeobotanical studies on Erlitou period Huizui site have confirmed a dominant dryland farming subsistence in this region. At least eighteen archaeobotanical taxa were identified, with foxtail millet as the most common single crop, followed by broomcorn millet (51). However, very few statistical analyses have been done to examine possible contextual factors contributing to the development of dryland farming in this area. This paper will conduct a statistical analysis on charred seeds from the Huizui site. It aims to study the relationship between certain seed densities (soybeans, foxtail millets, etc.) and some contextual factors such as archaeological feature types (ash pits, ditches, houses, etc.), time periods (Erlitou, Longshan, etc.), proportions of other seeds among total soil samples, etc. This analysis will help us better understand the farming patterns and possible drivers of dryland farming in the Huizui area.
